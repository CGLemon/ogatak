* Simple analysis GUI for [KataGo](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo) 1.7.0 or higher.
* Graphics modified from [Sabaki](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki), with thanks. Concept borrowed from [Lizzie](https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie).

## Upsides

* Relatively simple once set up.
* Has most normal Lizzie-like features (though not constant PV display).
* Correctly handles many SGF files that trouble other GUIs, especially handicaps and mid-game board edits.
* I personally like the aesthetics...

## Downsides

* KataGo not included, setup takes at least a minute's effort.
* Electron-based app, everyone hates these (they're big).
