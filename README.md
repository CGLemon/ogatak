* Simple analysis GUI for [KataGo](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo).
* Graphics modified from [Sabaki](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki), with thanks.
* Concept borrowed from [Lizzie](https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie).
* Requires a fairly recent version of KataGo (maybe 1.7.0 or so, who knows).

## Upsides

* Relatively simple once set up
* Correctly handles many SGF files that trouble other GUIs
* I personally like the aesthetics...

## Downsides

* Simple could mean "lacks some features"
* KataGo not included, setup takes at least a minute's effort
* Electron-based app, everyone hates these (they're big)
