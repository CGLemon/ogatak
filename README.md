Ogatak is a work-in-progress (currently rather simple minded) analysis GUI for [KataGo](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo).

Graphics modified from [Sabaki](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki), with thanks. The basic concept is of course rather borrowed from [Lizzie](https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie).
